Notes:</br>
<ul>
<li>You can create and modify 3D models using an open-source, freely available program called <a href='https://www.blender.org/'>Blender</a>.</li>
<li>Raw files with 3D models created by Blender have the <b>.BLEND</b> extension.</li>
<li>You should export 3D models into <b>.STL</b> format before printing them at the <a href='https://www.fablab-leuven.be/'>Fab-Lab</a>, KU Leuven.</li>
<li>The price for printing one running wheel at the Fab-Lab will hardly exceed 30 euros.</li>
<li>It takes 1 to 3 days to print one 3D model. This depends on the printer resolution set at the moment of purchase.</li>
<li>You can use the 3D Builder app provided by Microsoft to view 3D models on your Windows PC.</li>
<li>The original wheel was designed at the lab of <a href='http://www.vib.be/en/research/scientists/Pages/Vincent-Bonin-Lab.aspx'>Vincent Bonin</a> (see file "original Ben's design.stl").</li>
<li>File "smaller wheel with blades (149 mm diam, thickness 0.8 mm).stl" contains the latest design of the wheel used in the setup.</li>
