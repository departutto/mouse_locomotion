Total number of the retrieved data points is 437601.<br>
Out of those, 437601 points are proper real numbers.<br>
We used 1.00 cm/sec as the threshold to detect locomotion.<br>
The number of data points above the threshold is 371443 (84.88%).<br>
The number of data points below the threshold is 66158 (15.12%).<br>
The average locomotion speed is 18.32 cm/sec.<br>
The median locomotion speed is 18.00 cm/sec.<br>
The 25th-75th percentiles of the locomotion speed are [ 10.2  26.8] cm/sec.<br>
The standard deviation of the locomotion speed is 9.81 cm/sec.<br>
The maximum locomotion speed detected is 48.70 cm/sec.<br>
