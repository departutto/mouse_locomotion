* Stimuli were generated by running script generate_full_field_gratings.m on 16th April 2018.
* Each cell contains stimulus identifier (id). 
* File were named as follows: "id.jpg".
* Units: Spatial frequency = cycles per degree; Orientation = degree.
* Distance from the eye to the screen was set to 28.5 cm.
* Animal's eye is assumed to be aligned relative to the center of the screen.
* The viewing angle for the three spatial frequencies was 92.72 degree.
